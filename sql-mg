-- We're going to produce unique labels for our products to be printed off on reciepts and shipping labels.
-- The Rule for this label (using product_name):
-- all special characters should be removed/replaced with standard characters (eg. cöté -> cote, 's -> s)
-- The first letter of every word needs to be capitalized
-- no spaces between words
-- max of 11 characters total
